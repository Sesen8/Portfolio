        <h2>Program Management Intern - HP </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Vancouver, WA, June 2024 - August 2024 </li>
          <p>During my internship at HP, I was tasked with improving the team's ability to track performance and predict project outcomes. I developed custom metrics using **Jira (JQL)**, **Excel**, and **Looker** to enhance visibility into the team's performance and predictability. I worked closely with a team of 16 to track commitments and ensure that our quarterly goals were achievable, maintaining commitment predictability above **80%**. One of my main contributions was the creation of weekly performance charts, which allowed our team to track progress and understand potential bottlenecks in real time. Additionally, I gained initial exposure to **Jira scripting**, using **Python** to automate the extraction of key performance data through APIs, streamlining reporting processes and reducing manual effort.</p>

        <h2> Extended Reality Instructor - AVELA UW </h2>
        <ul> 
            <li>University of Washington, October 2024 - Present </li>
            <p>In my role as an **Extended Reality (XR) Instructor** at **AVELA**, I have been teaching high school students about Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (XR) technologies. I work alongside a team of instructors to design and deliver lesson plans, helping students develop their own **WebVR** applications. I have also guided them through the entire development process, from initial brainstorming to creating functional prototypes. This position has allowed me to deepen my understanding of XR concepts, as well as enhance my teaching skills. My work also includes helping students explore real-world applications of XR technologies, such as educational and entertainment tools, and ensuring that they grasp both the technical and creative aspects of XR development.</p>
